`print` is a built-in function in Python, and you’ll come across more of those later on. Function calls in Python always have a pair of parentheses attached, and if there are any arguments, they go inside the parentheses. So the print function syntax requires a set of parentheses and the argument is put inside the parentheses. As you’ve already seen, if you put a variable here, the thing that gets printed is the value of that variable, not the variable name.

Note: in Python 2, users didn’t need to use parentheses for printing, but in Python 3 they are required, so don’t miss them!

```
>>> print manila_pop
  File "<stdin>", line 1
    print manila_pop
                    ^
```                    
           
`SyntaxError: Missing parentheses in call to 'print'`
