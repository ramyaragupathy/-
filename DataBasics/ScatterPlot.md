Scatter plots are similar to line graphs in that they use horizontal and vertical axes to plot data points. However, they have a very specific purpose. Scatter plots show how much one variable is affected by another. The relationship between two variables is called their **correlation**.

Scatter plots usually consist of a large body of data. The closer the data points come when plotted to making a straight line, the higher the correlation between the two variables, or the stronger the relationship.

A scatterplot is a useful summary of a set of **bivariate data (two variables)**, usually drawn before working out a linear correlation coefficient or fitting a regression line. It gives a good visual picture of the relationship between the two variables, and aids the interpretation of the **correlation coefficient** or **regression model**.


## Types of association

- Positive linear association
- Negative linear association
- Non linear association (Curve, rather than a line eg: parabola)
- No linear association
